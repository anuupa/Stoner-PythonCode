<a name="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>The  <em>Stoner</em> Python package is a set of utility classes for writing data analysis code. It was written within 
the Condensed Matter Physics group at the University of Leeds as a shared resource for quickly writing simple 
programs to do things like fitting functions to data, extract curve parameters and churn through large numbers of 
small text data files.</p>

<p>For a general introduction, users are referred to the Users Guide pdf file that can be found in the <em>doc/UserGuide</em> directory in 
the github repository.  There is also an API reference in the form of a compiled help file in the <em>doc</em> directory that is 
generated with Sphinx from the embedded docstrings in the source code.</p>

<h2>
<a name="getting-this-code" class="anchor" href="#getting-this-code"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting this Code</h2>

<p>The <em>Stoner</em> package requires numpy &gt;=1.4, scipy &gt;=0.12, matplotlib &gt;=1.1 and h5py. Experimental code also makes use of
the Enthought Tools Suite packages.</p>

<p>The easiest way to install this code is via seuptools' easy_install:</p>

<pre><code>easy_install Stoner
</code></pre>

<p>This will install the Stoner package into your current Python environment. Since the package is under fairly
 constant updates, you might want to follow the development with git. The source code, along with example scripts
 and some sample data files can be obtained from the github repository: <a href="https://github.com/gb119/Stoner-PythonCode">https://github.com/gb119/Stoner-PythonCode</a></p>

<h2>
<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>The <strong>Stoner</strong> package provides two basic top-level classes that describe an individual file of experimental data and a 
list (such as a directory tree on disc) of many experimental files. For our research, a typical single experimental data file
is essentially a single 2D table of floating point numbers with associated metadata, usually saved in some
ASCII text format. This seems to cover most experiments in the physical sciences, but it you need a more complex 
format with more dimensions of data, we suggest you look elsewhere.</p>

<h3>
<a name="datafile-and-friends" class="anchor" href="#datafile-and-friends"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DataFile and Friends</h3>

<p><strong>Stoner.Core.DataFile</strong> is the base class for representing individual experimental data sets. 
It provides basic methods to examine and manipulate data, manage metadata and load and save data files. 
It has a large number of sub classes - most of these are in Stoner.FileFormats and are used to handle the loading of specific 
file formats. Two, however, contain additional functionality for writing analysis programs.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Stoner.Analysis.AnalyseFile</strong> provides additional methods for curve-fitting, differentiating, smoothing and carrying out 
basic calculations on data. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stoner.Plot.PlotFile</strong> provides additional routines for plotting data on 2D or 3D plots. </p></li>
</ul><p>As mentioned above, there are subclasses of <strong>DataFile</strong> in the <strong>Stoner.FileFormats</strong> module that support 
loading many of the common file formats used in our research.</p>

<h3>
<a name="datafolder" class="anchor" href="#datafolder"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DataFolder</h3>

<p><strong>Stoner.Folders.DataFolder</strong> is a class for assisting with the work of processing lots of files in a common directory 
structure. It provides methods to list. filter and group data according to filename patterns or metadata and then to execute
a function on each file or group of files.</p>

<p>The <strong>Stoner.HDF5</strong> module provides some experimental classes to manipulate <em>DataFile</em> and <em>DataFolder</em> objects within HDF5
format files. These are not a way to handle arbitary HDF5 files - the format is much to complex and flexible to make that
an easy task, rather it is a way to work with large numbers of experimental sets using just a single file which may be less
brutal to your computer's OS than having directory trees with millions of individual files.</p>

<h2>
<a name="resources" class="anchor" href="#resources"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resources</h2>

<p>Included in the source repository are a (small) collection of sample scripts for carrying out various operations and some sample data 
files for testing the loading and processing of data. Finally, this folder contains the LaTeX source code, dvi 
file and pdf version of the User Guide and this compiled help file which has been gerneated by Sphinx from the 
contents of the python docstrings in the source code.  The User Guide is partially ported to Sphinx format and is embedded in
the API documentation.</p>
